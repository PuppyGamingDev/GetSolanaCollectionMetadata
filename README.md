# Puppy's Get Metadata on Solana

### Import modules
`npm i @metaplex/js fs axios`

### Set your collection
Test using the provided `hashlist.json` or replace it with one for your desired collection of NFTs.

### Give it a run!
Simply run it by using `node grabdata.js`

### Sit and wait
This may take a while depending on collection size, but just leave it running and it'll get there. It will display in the console how many it has grabbed so far and once it's got them all it will export it to a file called `CollectionMetadata.json` in the same directory.
